# AESN-PSES: Large Language Model-Guided Evolutionary Algorithms for Path Planning and Optimization

## Overview

Path planning and optimization are essential challenges in fields like robotics, logistics, autonomous systems, and artificial intelligence. Traditional evolutionary algorithms (EAs) often suffer from slow convergence, suboptimal solutions, and population diversity issues. To address these limitations, we introduce the **Adaptive Evolutionary Search Network (AESN)**, an advanced framework that integrates **adaptive mechanisms, metaheuristic designs, and reinforcement learning techniques**.

AESN employs a hybrid strategy, **Problem-Specific Evolutionary Strategy (PSES)**, which combines customized solution representations, multi-objective optimization techniques, and surrogate modeling to improve the evolutionary process. This novel approach enhances computational efficiency and solution robustness, making it a powerful tool for path planning and optimization.
